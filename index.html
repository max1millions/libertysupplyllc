            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Founded on the 4th of July, 2017, by a retired career military professional with over 28 years of honorable military service in the fields of operations, logistics, and strategic planning, including two combat tours to Afghanistan and earning the Bronze Star Medal and numerous other awards for outstanding achievement and performance excellence.  This proven experience gives us a competitive edge in continuing to provide a high level of service to our nation as a defense contractor and service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB).</p>
